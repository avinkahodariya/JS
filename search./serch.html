                The purpose of our lives is to be happy
            </li>
            <li>
                Life is what happens when you’re busy making other plans
            </li>
            <li>
                Get busy living or get busy dying
            </li>
            <li>
                You only live once, but if you do it right, once is enough </li>
            <li>
                Many of life’s failures are people who did not realize how close they were to success when they gave up
            </li>
            <li>
                If you want to live a happy life, tie it to a goal, not to people or things
            </li>
            <li>
                Never let the fear of striking out keep you from playing the game
            </li>
            <li>
                Money and success don’t change people; they merely amplify what is already there
            </li>
